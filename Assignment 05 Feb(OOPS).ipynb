    "2.  Inheritance: It is the mechanism of creating new classes by inheriting properties and methods of an exixting class. This allows for code reuse and help to avoid redundancy. \n",

    "3. Polymorphism: It is the ability of an object to take on many forms, depending on the context in which it is used. Polymorphism allows for greater flexibility and extensibility in code.\n",

    "4.  Abstraction: It is the mechanism of representing complex real_world objects and system as simpler, abstract models. Abstraction helps to manage complexity and allows for easier development, maintenance and modification of code."
